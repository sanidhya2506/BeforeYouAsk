## ⚡ The Problem

Let’s be honest — nobody has the mental bandwidth for the  
**“So… tell me about yourself”** starter pack.

Repeating your entire life lore to every new person is inefficient, awkward, and outdated.

### The Small-Talk NPC Loop

- “Where are you actually from?”
- “What do you do?”
- “What did you study?”

Same script. Different NPCs.

## 🚀 The Solution

**BeforeYouAsk.** is your personal **context patch note**.

It’s a minimalist, high-speed web utility that compresses your **essential 9 identity signals** into **one clean, shareable link**.

You drop the link.  
They get the context.  
And the conversation jumps straight to substance.

No backstory grind. Just signal.
